# Task Timekeeper Web Server - Server

This is the webserver for managing multiple users' time manager data.

When running, swagger can be found at: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

TODO here (in the readme):
    - describe the stack (quarkus, eletryon security, mongo)
    - describe how to get it running
        - getting a mongo instance running
        - user management (connecting to external auth?)
        - point to other markdown/ resources on API (autogenerated?)



## The Stack

This server is fairly standalone, but relies on a Mongodb instance for storing data.

## TODO::

 - Tests
    - Password service
    - user registration service
 - user login (token return)
    - token creation
    - token validation
