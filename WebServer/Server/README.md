# Task Timekeeper Web Server - Server

This is the webserver for managing multiple users' time manager data.

For info on server administration, look at the [Admin Guide](Admin%20Guide.md)

When running, swagger can be found at: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html]()

TODO here (in the readme):
    - describe the stack (quarkus, eletryon security, mongo)
    - describe how to get it running
        - getting a mongo instance running
        - user management (connecting to external auth?)
        - point to other markdown/ resources on API (autogenerated?)
