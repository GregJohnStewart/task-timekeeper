TODO:: follow up to make sure everything gets autowired correctly

## Text email templates

easy peasy

## HTML Email templates - harder

In order to get nice looking emails, we currently use https://bootstrapemail.com/editor

Steps for updating the look of an email:

1. Copy in the main email template
2. (optional, if doing specific email) Copy in content from the email's 'plain' version
3. Make changes
4. Copy back over pre-processed html to template
5. Copy back over changed html to 'plain' version
