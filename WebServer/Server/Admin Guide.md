# Task Timekeeper Admin Guide

This is a guide for setting up the Task Timekeeper server to be used by users.

[TOC]

## Initial setup and running

### Setting up a Mongo instance

The server needs a MongoDB instance to connect to. It can be running really anywhere, as long as you have connection to it.

#### Getting a quick and easy MongoDB instance running (Podman (Docker))

##### 0) Install Podman (or docker)

https://podman.io/getting-started/installation.html

https://podman.io/getting-started/

##### 1) Setup data directory

```bash
sudo mkdir /data
sudo mkdir /data/db

sudo chown -R $USER /data 
sudo chgrp -R $USER /data 
```

##### 2) Create mongo container, tie it to the `/data/db` folder.  

`podman run --name timekeeper_mongo -p=27017:27017 --mount type=bind,destination=/data/db -d mongo`

You can make sure it is running using: `podman ps`

You can check the logs of the mongo instance using: `podman logs timekeeper-mongo`

To start it after the fact: `podman start timekeeper-mongo`

For admin of the server, one can use [MongoDb Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)

### Running the server

#### Running with container

TODO:: update this, Graal only required for native mode

##### Prerequisite: GraalVm

As a prerequisite, GraalVM must be used instead of an 'official' JDK.

[Official Reference from Graal](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/)

[A good reference for installing on Linux using alternatives (Preferred for Linux users)](https://gist.github.com/ricardozanini/fa65e485251913e1467837b1c5a8ed28)

##### Building the container

##### Running the container

#### Running "just the code"

To just get the server going to see how it all works, you just need to run:

`./gradlew :WebServer:Server:quarkusDev`

The project is setup to run just fine without any additional configuration to serve as a demo. Please see the section
 below on configuring the server to learn how to do so properly.

**Notes:**

- By design, the server will only run for 10 minutes if using the packaged keys used for jwts and ssl. This is to
 push server operators to use their own keys for the users' safety.
- Emails will not be sent without setting up email through configuration. At the moment, you can login without
 verifying your email, so you should be good to so. Some user related API calls might fail due to not being able to send
  emails.

## Configuring the server

https://quarkus.io/guides/config#overriding-properties-at-runtime

Using a configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`; By placing an application.properties file inside a directory named config which resides in the directory where the application runs, any runtime properties defined in that file will override the default configuration. Furthermore any runtime properties added to this file that were not part of the original application.properties file will also be taken into account. Do not tweak values in the src/main/resources/application.yaml, this particular file is automatically generated at build time and will be overwritten.

You can probably also use a yaml file.

### Connecting to a Mongodb instance

The configuration will by default try to connect to mongodb at `127.0.0.1:27017`. It will use the `task-timekeeper` database name and `task-timekeeper-server` application name.

More information on how to configure the Mongo client can be found on the [all config options guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/all-config#quarkus-mongodb-client_quarkus-mongodb-client).

### Setting Up Your Information

You can define specific info about your server, like the server's name and contact information:

```yaml
runningInfo:
  organization: # The organization running the server. Defaults to "The Testing Organization"
  serverName:   # The name of the server. Defaults to organization
  orgUrl:       # URL to the organization or running party
  hostname:     # Hostname to use to hit this service. Defaults to "localhost"
  port:			# Port to use to hit the service. Defaults to the config value "quarkus.http.port"
  contactInfo:
    name:       # the name for the main contact
    email:      # the email of the main contact
    phone:  # the telephone number of the main contact
```

Notes:

- These mainly show up in the web ui, but can also be accessed at `/api/server/info`.
- This configuration is optional (in whole or part), but will help your users distinguish it from other running instances.
- `runningInfo.serverName` is used in the context of: "<serverName> Task Timekeeper Server"
- `hostname` and `port` do _not_ change the actual host/port of the service. These values are used to build url's for the server to link to itself. The purpose is to be able to be placed behind a network or firewall. For instance, if you wanted to run the server in your home network and access it from outside it, you would set the `hostname` to your network's ip/host, and `port` to the port you are using to forward in.

### Setting up Email

https://quarkus.io/guides/all-config#quarkus-mailer_quarkus-mailer



### Security/ Keys

TODO:: jwt tokens vs https/ ssl tokens

The service requires a `.pem` public and private key to make JWT tokens for users to login with. The private key must be in `pkcs8` format.

Test keys are in the test resources directory, under 'security'. You will have to make your own and specify the location of the `.pem`s with the `mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location` and `mp.jwt.verify.privatekey.location` properties.

You can also specify the issuer of the key using: `mp.jwt.verify.issuer`, but one will be automatically gleaned from the `runningInfo` configuration (see [Setting Up Your Information](#Setting_Up_Your_Information)).

The test keys were created using the following command:

```
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 4096
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
# convert private key to pkcs8 format in order to import it from Java
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in private_key.pem -inform pem -out private_key_pkcs8.pem -outform pem -nocrypt
```

Given the previous commands, you would set `mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location` to the location of `public_key.pem`, and `mp.jwt.verify.privatekey.location` to the location of `private_key_pkcs8.pem`.  

If you are a 'real organization' you might want to use keys that were issued by a real cert provider.

#### The Packaged Keys

There is a set of packaged keys to enable running right off the bat, but you _should not_ use them in production under any circumstances. The service will only run for ten minutes if these keys are used. 

### User

There are a couple of configurations related to the users themselves:

`user.new.autoApprove` - If set to `true`, will automatically approve new users. Otherwise, an admin will have to approve their account before they are allowed to login.

## Runtime Administration

### User/ User Management

#### Admin Rights

Admins will be able to do the following to other users:

- approve
- disapprove
- lock
- promote/ demote admin status

#### User Workflows

##### Account Creation

###### First User

```sequence
First User->Task Timekeeper: Sends account create request
Note right of Task Timekeeper: Verifies user data
Note right of Task Timekeeper: Approves user
Note right of Task Timekeeper: Makes user admin
Task Timekeeper->First User: Sends Verification Email
Task Timekeeper->First User: Returns creation response
First User -> Task Timekeeper: clicks email validation link
Note right of Task Timekeeper: Marks user's account as validated
Note right of First User: User now allowed to login, has admin priviliges
```

###### Nth user

```sequence
New User->Task Timekeeper: Sends account create request
Note right of Task Timekeeper: Verifies user data
Note right of Task Timekeeper: <if set to auto approve> Approves user
Task Timekeeper->New User: Sends Verification Email

```



##### Password Reset

```sequence
User->Task Timekeeper: Sends password reset request
Note right of Task Timekeeper: Generates reset token
Task Timekeeper -> User: Sends user email with reset link with token
User -> Task Timekeeper: Clicks reset link with token
Note right of Task Timekeeper: Verifies token
Task Timekeeper -> User: Temporary, short lived JWT token for resetting password (token JUST for reset)
User -> Task Timekeeper: Uses temp token to reset password
Task Timekeeper -> User: Notifies that password was reset
```



##### Email Change

```sequence
User->Task Timekeeper: Sends email change request (requires jwt)
Note right of Task Timekeeper: Generates email change token
Task Timekeeper -> User: Sends alert email to old email that email being changed
Task Timekeeper -> User: Sends user email at new address with reset link with token
User -> Task Timekeeper: Clicks email change link with token
Note right of Task Timekeeper: Verifies token, updates email
Task Timekeeper -> User: Alerts to old email about change
Task Timekeeper -> User: Alerts to new email about change
```
