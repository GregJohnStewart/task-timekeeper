# Task-Timekeeper Webserver

This is the webserver implementation of Task-timekeeper. Currently nonfunctional, very much in development

## The Stack

The main server uses the [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) framework in order to make the running server as light as possible. For how to build and run this server, see [our guide](build-run_notes.md)
