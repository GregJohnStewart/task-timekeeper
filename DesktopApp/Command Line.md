# Task Timekeeper Command Line User Guide

This is a guide for using Task Timekeeper in either `MANAGE` or `SINGLE` mode.

Configuration arguments in the README of the desktop app are not explained here, as they are independent of telling the app of what to do. To learn about configuration, go to the [main readme](README.md)

[Skip to examples](#workflow-examples-cheat-sheet)

Note: in the following examples, replace `<datetime>` with a valid datetime format. See the [inputting date/times](#inputting-timedates) section.

TODO:: use the following to generate docs from markdown files to package with install: https://concordion.org/tutorial/java/markdown/

### `MANAGE` vs `SINGLE` Mode:

`MANAGE` mode is simply a continuous version of `SINGLE`. In single mode, you enter your command in the initial call to the program, and only that one command is run. In Manage mode, you simply run the program in this mode and are entered into a new command prompt to enter in multiple commands (one at a time).

## Usage

**Why the backslashes between words?**

In this guide you will see things like the following: `-n Task\ Name`

This is meant to express how you will need to enter in strings with spaces in managed mode. When processing in single mode, you can simply throw quotes around the value (I.e., `"Task Name"`, as the shell knows how to interpret that.

In managed mode, however, the parser is not quite as sophisticated. It splits your input on spaces, ignoring escaped spaces (`\ `). It does not know to look for quoted strings as one value. Therefore, in managed mode, spaces in string inputs require spaces to be escaped.

This guide has all example strings with escaped spaces because doing this would work for both managed and single mode, whereas quoted strings would only be valid for single mode. 

### Breakdown of a command

In general, you must always specify two things:

- The object type you are doing something with, speified by `-o`.
- The action you are performing, specified by `-a`.

The exception here is with the special commands, which don't need these set.

### Working with Tasks

#### Viewing tasks

`-a view -o task`

This lists all the tasks held.

You can also search for tasks by name using any standard regex pattern:

`-a view -o task -n NameRegex`

This can be further narrowed down by specifying attributes the tasks should have:

`-a view -o task -att attName -atv attVal`

#### Adding a task

The syntax for adding a task is simple.

`-a create -o task -n Task\ Name`

Here, `-a create -o task` specifies we want to create an object of type task, and `-n Task\ Name` specifies that we are giving it the name "Task Name".

You can also specify a custom attribute when creating:

`-a create -o task -n TaskName -att charge\ code -atv 12345`

Where `-att chargeCode` specifies we are giving it an attribute named "charge code", and `-atv 12345` specifies that we give that attribute a value of "12345".

#### Modifying a task

TODO:: explain index method of selecting task to modify

##### Changing the task's name

`-a edit -o task -n Task\ Name -nn New\ Task\ Name`

This changes the "Task Name" task to have the new name "New Task Name". `-n Task\ Name` specifies the name of the task to change, while `-nn New\ Task\ Name` specifies the new name to give it.

##### Changing a task's attributes

###### Adding/ Updating an attribute

`-a edit -o task -n Task\ Name -att charge\ code -atv 1234567`

This either adds or updates the attribute "charge code", giving it the value "1234567". `-at charge\ code` specifies the "charge code" attribute, while `-atv 12334567` supplies the value to give it. 

###### Removing an attribute

`-a edit -o task -n Task\ Name -att charge\ code`

This removes the attribute "charge code" from the "Task Name" task; simply not specifying the value to give the attribute tells the program to remove it.

#### Removing a task

TODO:: explain index method of selecting task to remove

`-a remove -o task -n Task\ Name`

This removes the task "Task Name" from the list of tasks.

This can fail if there are timespans that use this task.

### Working with Periods

#### Viewing Work Periods

To view all periods held:

`-a view -o period`

You can view periods before and after certain datetimes:

`-a view -o period -bf <datetime> -af <datetime>`

#### Adding a work period

`-a add -o period`

This adds a new work period. The created period should be the first one in a viewing of periods. Note this alone does not select the newly created period (unless in single mode) nor does it finish any tasks in previously created periods.

You can specify to select the new period by specifying to do so with the command:

`-a add -o period -se`

You can specify a key/val attribute pair when adding:

`-a add -o period -att key -atv value`

#### Updating a work period

All modifications on a period affect the selected period. In single mode, this is the most recent period.

##### Changing a periods's attributes

###### Adding/ Updating an attribute

`-a edit -o period -att charge\ code -atv 1234567`

This either adds or updates the attribute "charge code", giving it the value "1234567". `-at charge\ code` specifies the "charge code" attribute, while `-atv 12334567` supplies the value to give it. 

###### Removing an attribute

`-a edit -o period -att charge\ code`

This removes the attribute "charge code" from the selected period; simply not specifying the value to give the attribute tells the program to remove it.

#### Removing a work period

##### Removing by index

TODO

##### Removing based on datetime

You can remove work periods based on datetimes.

Note: in the following examples, replace <datetime> with a valid datetime format. See the [inputting date/times](#inputting-timedates) section.

###### Removing periods before a datetime

`-a remove -o period -bf <datetime>`

The `-bf <datetime>` parameter specifies to remove periods before the given datetime. 

###### Removing periods before a datetime

`-a remove -o period -af <datetime>`

The `-af <datetime>` parameter specifies to remove periods after the given datetime.

###### Removing periods between two datetimes

`-a remove -o period -bf <datetime> -af <datetime>`

The `-bf <datetime>` parameter specifies to remove periods before the given datetime. 

### Working with Spans

#### Viewing spans

`-a view -o span`

This views the spans in the current work period.

#### Adding spans

`-a add -o span -n Task\ Name`

This adds a new timespan to the selected work period. Note this does not give the new span a start or end datetime.

To give the new span start and end datetimes, use the `-st` and `-en` arguments, respectively:

`-a add -o span -n Task\ Name -st <datetime> -en <datetime>`

Note that you can specify only one or the other here, and that if specified together, the starting datetime must be before the ending one.

#### Editing spans

Note that all operations deal with spans held in the selected period.

##### Editing the span's task

`-a edit -o span -i 1 -n Task\ Name`

This sets the span at index `1`'s task to the task named `Task Name`

##### Editing the span's start and end times

`-a edit -o span -i 1 -st <datetime> -en <datetime>`

This edits the span at index `1`'s starting and ending datetimes using the `-st` and `-en` arguments, respectively. You can also use the arguments independently from eachother, if you only want to update one at a time.  

#### Removing spans

`-a remove -o span -i 1`

Removes the timespan at the index given from the selected period.

### Inputting time/dates

This section outlines the different formats you can use to input datetimes. Not that only local datetimes are used, and timezones are not considered.

#### ISO Formats

You can enter any ISO formatted datetime, minus the timezone.

#### Human friendly formats

Here is a list of some more friendly formats for entering datetimes:

- `d/M h:m a y` day/month hour:minute (am/pm) year
- `d/M H:m y` day/month 24-hour:minute year 
- `d/M y` day/month year (sets time to midnight)
- `h:m a` hour:minute (am/pm) (sets date to current)
- `H:m` 24-hour:minute (sets date to current)

#### Shortcuts

- `NOW` What it sounds like, the current day/time
- `LAST_WEEK` Midnight of the start of last week
- `THIS_WEEK` Midnight of the start of this week
- `NEXT_WEEK` Midnight of the start of next week

### Special Commands

Special commands are commands that exist to streamline the process of using this program.

Note that the command is not case sensitive.

#### `completeSpans`

`-s completeSpans`

Completes remaining timespans in selected period, giving them an end datetime of now (when the command is run). If uncompleted timespan started in the future, gives that span and and datetime of one second after start. 

#### `newSpan`

`-s newSpan -n Task\ Name`

Completes remaining timespans in the selected period (as done in `completeSpans`) and starts a new one in the selected period. Need to have period selected and task specified with `-n`.

#### `selectNewest`

`-s selectNewest`

This simply selects the newest period held.

#### `newPeriod`

`-s newPeriod`

This completes remaining timespans in the current period (if one is selected), creates a new work period and selects it.

## Workflow Examples (cheat sheet)

Examples of working through common tasks. Listed are arguments to pass, which can be given when using either single or managed mode.

This section is meant to be a quick reference guide, view the sections above for more details and explanations.
