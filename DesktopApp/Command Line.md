# Task Timekeeper Command Line User Guide

This is a guide for using Task Timekeeper in either `MANAGE` or `SINGLE` mode.

Configuration arguments in the README of the desktop app are not explained here, as they are independent of telling the app of what to do. To learn about configuration, go to the [main readme](README.md)

### `MANAGE` vs `SINGLE` Mode:

`MANAGE` mode is simply a continuous version of `SINGLE`. In single mode, you enter your command in the initial call to the program, and only that one command is run. In Manage mode, you simply run the program in this mode and are entered into a new command prompt to enter in multiple commands (one at a time).
