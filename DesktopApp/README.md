# Task Timekeeper Desktop App

This is the desktop app for Task Timekeeper. Requires Java 11 to run.

## Workflow

In general, this is how one works with Task Timekeeper:

 - Make tasks to associate with timespans
 - Make a new work period to add spans to
 - Add spans to the work period
   - You can add spans without specifying end time, you can complete the span later, when you finish working
 - repeat as you do work
 - review the time you spent on what tasks for either a certain period or over a few periods 


## Configuration

## Command line interaction

To learn how to interact with the program from the command line, look [here](Command%20Line.md)

It should be noted that in single mode, one can only operate on the latest work period (it is automatically selected and cannot be changed).
